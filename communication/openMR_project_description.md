# With eCOBIDAS you will never have to write a method section ever again

## Project Description

The eCOBIDAS app is meant to provide neuroimaging, EEG, MEG researchers with a clickable methods checklist that can **automatically** generate most of the method section of a f/MRI or EEG / MEEG paper.

We already have a early [prototype of the app](https://cobidas-checklist.herokuapp.com) that provides a short checklist of many methodological aspects of a typical fMRI study and that can generate a small text files containing the response given by the user to each item.

### Specific goal

One big piece that is still missing to have good proof of concept for this app is the boilerplate text that the app will generate.

So the goal of this hackathon is to create template methods section with blanks or several options to adapt to the responses provided by users.

## Skills required to participate

No specific technical skill is required as most of the work will be done collaboratively in [a google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oRDVOORap2aUSpxoi6432_uYpcM1EhG6bLK7ZlCUZvw/edit?usp=sharing).

Some prior experience with MRI would be helpful.

### Coding skills

No coding sills required: most of the work will be done in a google doc.

But we are looking for people with some knowledge in javascript and/or python for later goals unrelated to this hackathon. :-)


### Software specific sills

No software specific sills required.

Some prior experience with some of the typical MRI analysis software (SPM, FSL, freesurfer, AFNI...) could be useful.


### GIT / GITHUB skills required

GIT - 0 : no prior git knowledge needed but you will have the possibility to learn some if you want.


## Integration
Because this eCOBIDAS app is meant to be used by a wide range of users in the neuroimaging, EEG, MEG community, we want to make sure that it can respond to a very wide range of needs. So even if you only have little time during the openMR2020 event, drop by to learn more about the app and give us feedback or ideas.


## Preparation material

-   The [prototype of the eCOBIDAS checklist app](https://cobidas-checklist.herokuapp.com)

-   The MRI spreadsheet containing all the items of the COBIDAS checklist is accessible [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dCXP0MTK3DjY09ZFd7FXgv0Ngx16_YJwVBiXOeQbTho/edit?usp=sharing)

-   Some of the boilerplate section that already exist out there have been collected and can be accessed on the [dedicated branch the app repository](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls/tree/remi-dev_boilerplate/boilerplate).

-   The excellent Jeanette Mumford has a [30 min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsM4KowO5Vc&t=175s) explaining the background behind the COBIDAS report and giving a run through of the checklist.

## Communication

During the openMR2020 event, you can reach us on the hackathon-COBIDAS channel of the openMR slack workspace.

Otherwise we are mostly on the [cobidas_checklist of the brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/cobidas_checklist).
